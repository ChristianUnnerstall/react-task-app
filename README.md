# React Task App

This project is kind of a learning experience to get the basic concepts of react apps.
At this point the app is only displaying a simple form with some inline editing function.

The idea is to not use to many libraries. Create stuff on my own.

Next steps are:
- Enhance the functionality to store data using API backend
- Make the basic app function.
